If you peek into the browser console, you'll notice you get the following output:

```
Uncaught Error: Exception
```

Likewise if you run this from the CLI, you'll get a similar output:

```sh
$ dart error.dart 
Unhandled exception:
Exception
```

"Uncaught Error"... Hmm, okay, let's try to catch it.
